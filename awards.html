        <h2 class="warm">Awards</h2>
        <p>My in-depth reporting has earned several distinguished awards,
          including first place in the 54th Annual Hearst Journalism Awards
          program, and a regional Edward R. Murrow award.</p>

        <h4 class="warm">Hearst Journalism Awards Program</h4>
        <p>My reporting received top awards, over a record 52 entries in the
          54th annual Hearst Journalism Awards Program’s Radio News & Features
          Competition.</p>

        <p>Two stories formed my winning entry. The first, “<a target="_blank" href="http://kbia.org/post/what-does-your-local-vfw-have-common-your-church">
            What does your local VFW have in common with your church?</a>“, aired on KBIA-FM, an
          NPR Affiliate, and was created as part of <a target="_blank" href="http://project573.wix.com/religion">Project 573</a>, a series of
          stories focused on a single issue, which are
          published by multiple newsrooms. The project receives its name from
          the area code which includes Columbia, Mo.</p>

        <p><a target="_blank" href="http://project573.wix.com/religion">Project 573</a> focused on the growing number of Americans who did not affiliate with a specific religion, and was coordinated by Missouri School of Journalism Professors Jacqui
          Banaszynski and Reuben Stern.</p>
        <p>The
          second entry
          “<a target="_blank" href="http://kbia.org/post/rural-mo-town-now-ghost-past-settlement">Rural Missouri town now a ‘ghost of a past
            settlement</a>,” focused on a small Missouri town, Goss, Mo., which had
          dwindled to a population of zero. Here, I explored how this small town
          fits into larger population shifts.
          Although Goss is located alongside a railroad, roads improved following
          World War II, and Goss residents drove elsewhere for errands. One by
          one, the stores in Goss closed up.</p>

        <p>The prize included a $2,600 award.</p>

        <p>Audio of both stories is available on this website, under the
          <a href="kbia.html">KBIA News section</a>.</p>

        <p><b>Please note</b>: The audio featured on this website are
          longer versions of the stories than were submitted to the Hearst Awards
          Program.</p>

        <h4 class="warm">Edward R. Murrow Award</h4>
        <p>The Radio Television Digital News Association (RTDNA) also presented
          KBIA-FM with three Edward R. Murrow Awards. I stood among one of the
          many journalists contributing to KBIA-FM’s success, with his story
          “<a target="_blank" href="http://kbia.org/post/rural-mo-town-now-ghost-past-settlement">
            Rural Missouri town now a ‘ghost of a past settlement</a>.”</p>

        <p>I worked with KBIA Producer Kristofor Husted on the story.</p>

        <h4 class="warm">Missouri School of Journalism: Mastering the Method</h4>
        <p>The Missouri School of Journalism presented Lukas with the
          Mastering the Method award for radio excellence.</p>

        <p>“The judges said both of Udstuen’s features were examples of what
          public radio does best – using great writing, natural sounds and
          scenes to explore a unique, under-reported aspect of our culture,”
          according to <a target="_blank" href="http://journalism.missouri.edu/2013/12/bridgit-bowden-lukas-udstuen-win-deans-award-radio-news-features-mastering-method-contest/">the Missouri School of
            Journalism</a>.</p>

        <p>The entry consisted of two stories: “<a target="_blank" href="http://kbia.org/post/what-does-your-local-vfw-have-common-your-church">What does your local
            VFW have in common with your church?</a>” and “<a target="_blank" href="http://kbia.org/post/rural-mo-town-now-ghost-past-settlement">Rural Missouri town now a ‘ghost of a past settlement</a>.”</p>
